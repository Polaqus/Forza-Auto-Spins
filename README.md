# Forza-Auto-Spins
an (bad) AHK script to automatically buy super wheelspins
## Prerequisites
This script assumes that you have:
 - 1 Pontiac GTO
 - 1 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am
 - 1 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am GTA Forza Edition
 - however many Pontiac Firebird Trans Am GTA's you want (referred here as 'wheelspins machines', **ALL OF THEM HAVE TO BE NEW SO THE OPENING ANIMATION PLAYS**)
 - and finally some common sense to edit the script in case it fucks up (which is pretty likely) 
## Usage
- Open the script, edit the pontiacs variable to reflect the amount of your current wheelspins machines 
- edit the 'path' to porsche (what you need to press to get to porsche in the manufacturer selection tab)
- exit to the 'garage' tab and press Ctrl + L to start the script
- press F12 to close the script in case something goes wrong 
## Questions or w/e
"Is this faster than doing the whole process manually?"  
Hell nah, this script is bad

"What if I have more than 1 of other Pontiac cars?  
Then you're out of luck, I'm too stupid to make it work 

"Wait, then why would I want to use this shitty script?"  
Idk, maybe you're just lazy like me lol
